# Clustering-and-Classification

1.	Clustering (Self-Organizing Map)
First, Mush Farmoatic wants to group the mushroom based on the similarities in mushroom physical feature. 
To do that, you are going to use Kohonen Self-Organizing Map technique to cluster the data.

2.	Classification
In addition to cluster similar edible mushroom traits, Mush Farmoatic also wants you to create an application that can help them classify the status of the mushroom they sell. 
In order to do that, you will be given a dataset labeled with overall status of the mushroom which depends on various traits of the mushroom.
